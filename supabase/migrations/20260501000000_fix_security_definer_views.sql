-- Fix: SECURITY DEFINER warnings on the 4 analytics views
-- By default Postgres CREATE VIEW runs as the view OWNER (= SECURITY DEFINER),
-- bypassing the calling user's RLS. Recreate them with `security_invoker=on`
-- so they respect the caller's permissions just like a regular query.
-- Requires Postgres 15+ (Supabase runs 15+).
